          <p>
            Thomas served in World War I with the rank of Sergeant Major and
            received medals for gallantry (which he threw away in a canal after
            returning from the war). His experiences in World War I left him
            disillusioned and beset with ongoing nightmares, and he becomes
            determined to move his family up in the world so that the powers who
            had always mistreated them could no longer touch them.

            Elizabeth Pollyanna "Polly" Gray (née Shelby) is one of the two
            former tritagonists (alongside John Shelby) of Peaky Blinders. She
            is the mother of Michael and Anna Gray, aunt of Arthur, Thomas,
            John, Ada and Finn Shelby, as well as being the matriarch of the
            Shelby Family. She is part of the Birmingham criminal gang, the
            Peaky Blinders, a certified accountant and company treasurer of
            Shelby Company Limited.

          <h2>Ada Shelby</h2>
          <p>
            Ada Thorne (née Shelby) is the tritagonist of Peaky Blinders. She is
            the fourth and only female of the Shelby siblings and the only
            sibling initially not involved with the Peaky Blinders. By the end
            of 1924, however, Ada assumes a leading position at the United
            States branch of Shelby Company Limited, dealing only with legal
            acquisitions; unlike her brothers back home in Birmingham, England.
            She is the widow of known communist, Freddie Thorne, with who she
            has a son, Karl Thorne — named after Karl Marx.
